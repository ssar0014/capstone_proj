The masks were made from what looks like tin foil. <br /><br />The Gore: The Gore was pretty good, I must give it that. But Ittenbach\\'s Burning moon was better for a low budget movie. <br /><br />Acting: Was horrible! I didn\\'t mind the dubbing. I find this humorous like in Ittenbach\\'s \"Premutos\" (great movie). The fighting and action sequences were pi$$ poor.<br /><br />Bottom line: Don\\'t watch any of Schnaas\\'s movies. There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter. Check Premutos, House of blood, Schramm and the nekromantiks.'"
